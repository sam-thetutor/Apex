7. Copy both files to `/public/` folder

#### Option B: Use Canva

1. Go to [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
2. Create a design (512x512 pixels)
3. Add your logo or text "A"
4. Export as PNG
5. Resize to both 192x192 and 512x512

2. Open http://localhost:3000
3. Take a screenshot of your app
4. Crop to 1280x720 pixels
5. Save as `screenshot-1.png` in `/public/` folder

### Step 3: Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Farcaster deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel:**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = Your OpenAI API key
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Note your Vercel URL:**
   - Example: `https://apex-base.vercel.app`
   - You'll need this for the next steps

### Step 4: Update Manifest with Your Domain

1. Open `/public/.well-known/farcaster.json`
2. Replace all instances of `your-domain.vercel.app` with your actual Vercel URL
3. Save the file

Example:
```json
{
  "miniapp": {
    "iconUrl": "https://apex-base.vercel.app/icon-512.png",
    "homeUrl": "https://apex-base.vercel.app",
    ...
  }
}
```

4. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add public/.well-known/farcaster.json
   git commit -m "Update manifest with production domain"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 5: Sign Your Manifest

1. **Go to Farcaster Developer Portal:**
   - Visit: https://farcaster.xyz/~/developers/mini-apps/manifest
   - Make sure you're logged into Farcaster

2. **Enter your domain:**
   - Enter your Vercel URL (e.g., `apex-base.vercel.app`)
   - Click "Sign Manifest"

3. **Copy the signed data:**
   - You'll receive a JSON object with `header`, `payload`, and `signature`
   - Copy this entire object

4. **Update your manifest:**
   - Open `/public/.well-known/farcaster.json`
   - Replace the `accountAssociation` object with the signed data from step 3
   - Save the file

5. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add public/.well-known/farcaster.json
   git commit -m "Add signed account association"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 6: Test Your Mini App

2. **Test the manifest:**
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.vercel.app/.well-known/farcaster.json
