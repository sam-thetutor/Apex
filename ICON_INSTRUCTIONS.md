# Icon Creation Instructions

## Required Icons

Your Farcaster Mini App needs the following icons:

1. **icon-192.png** - 192x192 pixels
2. **icon-512.png** - 512x512 pixels
3. **screenshot-1.png** - 1280x720 pixels (app screenshot)

## Quick Creation Methods

### Method 1: Use Online Tools (Easiest)

#### For App Icons:
1. Go to [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/)
2. Use the "Text to Favicon" tool
3. Enter "A" as the text
4. Choose colors: Teal (#14b8a6) background, White text
5. Download and rename:
   - `android-chrome-192x192.png` → `icon-192.png`
   - `android-chrome-512x512.png` → `icon-512.png`

#### For Screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of your app running
2. Crop to 1280x720 pixels
3. Save as `screenshot-1.png`

### Method 2: Use Canva

1. Go to [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)
2. Create a new design:
   - For icons: 512x512 pixels
   - For screenshot: 1280x720 pixels
3. Use the template or create from scratch
4. Export as PNG

### Method 3: Use Design Tools

If you have Figma, Adobe Illustrator, or Photoshop:

#### Icon Design:
- Size: 512x512 pixels
- Background: Teal gradient (#14b8a6 to #2dd4bf)
- Text: "A" in white, bold, centered
- Border radius: 128px (rounded corners)

#### Screenshot:
- Take a screenshot of your app
- Ensure it shows the main features
- Crop to 1280x720 pixels

### Method 4: Use the SVG Template

I've created a simple SVG template at `/public/icon.svg`. You can:

1. Open it in any image editor
2. Customize the design
3. Export as PNG at different sizes

## Icon Design Guidelines

### Colors
- Primary: Teal (#14b8a6)
- Secondary: Cyan (#2dd4bf)
- Text: White (#FFFFFF)
- Background: Gradient from primary to secondary

### Design Tips
- Keep it simple and recognizable
- Use high contrast
- Ensure it looks good at small sizes
- Avoid fine details that won't scale
- Test at different sizes

## File Placement

Place all icons in the `/public` folder:

```
public/
├── icon-192.png
├── icon-512.png
├── screenshot-1.png
└── icon.svg (template)
```

## Testing Your Icons

After creating your icons:

1. Check they're accessible:
   ```bash
   # Test locally
   open http://localhost:3000/icon-512.png
   
   # Test after deployment
   curl https://your-app.vercel.app/icon-512.png
   ```

2. Verify file sizes:
   - icon-192.png should be ~5-20 KB
   - icon-512.png should be ~10-50 KB
   - screenshot-1.png should be ~100-500 KB

3. Check they display correctly in Farcaster

## Alternative: Use a Logo Generator

If you want a more professional icon:

1. Go to [LogoMakr](https://logomakr.com/)
2. Create a logo with "Apex" or "A"
3. Download and resize to required dimensions
4. Use an image editor to adjust

## Quick Command to Create Icons (Mac)

If you have ImageMagick installed:

```bash
# Convert SVG to PNG
convert -background "#14b8a6" -size 512x512 -gravity center label:"A" public/icon-512.png
convert -background "#14b8a6" -size 192x192 -gravity center label:"A" public/icon-192.png

# Take a screenshot (Mac)

```
